# Airline_Delay_Analysis


### Introduction

#### Project Title: Analyzing and Predicting Flight Delays

##### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to analyze historical flight delay data for Endeavor Air Inc. and develop predictive models to forecast future flight delays. By understanding the factors contributing to delays and accurately predicting future delays, the project seeks to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and aid decision-making processes within the airline industry.

#### Objectives
* Data Analysis: To perform a comprehensive analysis of flight delay data, identifying key patterns, trends, and contributing factors.
* Delay Classification: To classify the different types of delays (e.g., carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft) and determine their frequency and impact.
* Predictive Modeling: To develop machine learning models that can predict the total arrival delay based on historical data and various influencing factors.
* Visualization: To create visual representations of the data and predictions to facilitate easy interpretation and insights.

#### Tools and Technologies
To achieve these objectives, the following tools and technologies will be used:

* Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

** Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
** NumPy: For numerical computations.
** Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
** Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
** Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and visualization.

* Data Visualization Tools: To create insightful and interactive visualizations.

** Matplotlib and Seaborn: For static plots and charts.

* Machine Learning Models:

** Linear Regression: To establish a baseline model for predicting flight delays.
** Random Forest: For capturing non-linear relationships and improving prediction accuracy.
** Gradient Boosting Machines: For enhanced predictive performance.
** Classification Algorithms: Such as Random Forest Classifier, to predict whether a flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes.

Data Sources: The project utilizes historical flight delay data obtained from reliable aviation databases or provided datasets (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp).

#### Methodology
* Data Collection: Gather historical flight delay data for Endeavor Air Inc.
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare the data for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
* Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that will be used for predictive modeling.
* Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict flight delays.
* Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
* Visualization: Create visual representations of the data analysis and model predictions.

#### Expected Outcomes
The expected outcomes of this project include:

* A detailed analysis of flight delays for Endeavor Air Inc. with insights into the primary causes of delays.
* Predictive models that can accurately forecast flight delays, enabling proactive measures to mitigate delays.
* Visualizations that effectively communicate findings and predictions to stakeholders.
